# Assessment-of-diversity-and-gender-equality-in-OR
This is my master's project.
There are two main purposes of this project
The first purpose is to analyze geographical diversity in OR, I used VOSviewer software to identify countries/regions of publications in OR
The second purpose is to utilize machine learning and deep learning to classify gender based on first names. 
Besides, this project built my abilities on data visualization and statistical analysis. 

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes **geographical diversity** and **gender representation** in Operational Research (OR) academia by examining publication trends in ten leading journals from 2013 to 2022.

**Key Research Questions**
1. How has the geographical distribution of OR publications evolved over the past decade, and which countries lead in output?  
2. How have trends in gender representation among OR scholars changed, and how consistent are these trends across journals?

**Methodology**
Data Sources: Scopus, Kaggle  
Techniques: Data preprocessing, gender classification (Gender-Guesser, Machine Learning)  
Tools: Python, VOSviewer

**Key Findings**
1. Geographical Diversity:  
   OR academia shows diversity, but publications are dominated by a few countries (U.S., UK, and China).  
  Implication: Encourage international collaborations and support underrepresented regions.  

2. Gender Representation:  
OR remains male-dominated, though *Computers and Operations Research* shows a significant increase in female authorship.  
Implication: Promoting gender diversity can enhance research productivity and innovation.

**Target Audience**
Academics, Researchers, Journal Editors, and Policy Makers in OR and STEM.

**Contributions**
This study highlights the importance of addressing imbalances in diversity and gender equality to enrich the OR academic landscape.
